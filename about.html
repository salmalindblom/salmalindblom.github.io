               I was introduced to printmaking by my sister, who gifted me a print of hers. I was interested in how she created the image because it had a much more classical feeling than a drawing. This inspired me to pursue printmaking on my own.


               <br><br>To date, I only do mezzotint and once in awhile do drypoint. Currently, I am creating a collection of mezzotint still-life that portrays the area that I grew up in. Some things are trees, pinecones, shells, and buildings.


               <br><br>I am just beginning my printmaking journey. Luckily, my drawing skill has come in handy for how I portray my etchings. I am a photorealist. I hope you enjoy my prints.
