     <p>I was introduced to printmaking by my sister, who gifted me a print of hers. I was interested in how she created the image because it had a much more classical feeling than a drawing. This inspired me to pursue printmaking on my own.
     </p>

     <p>To date, I only do mezzotint and once in awhile do drypoint. Currently, I am creating a collection of mezzotint still-life that portrays the area that I grew up in. Some things are trees, pinecones, shells, and buildings.
     </p>

     <p>My skills are beginner, but my drawing skill has come in handy for how I portray my etchings. I am a photorealist.
